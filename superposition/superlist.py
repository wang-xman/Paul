Superlist validator and validation error.

A superlist is a list of tuples.

First element of each tuple is often referred to
as 'amplitude'. The second element is 'component'.
Tuple is usually referred to as 'member'.

In this terminology, a superlist looks like
    `[member, member, ...]`
and each member is (amplitude, component).

In a superlist, the algebraic relationship between any
two tuples is addition (+); within each tuple, the
relationship between two elements is multiplication.
